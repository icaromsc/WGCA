.SH "NAME"
Type::Tiny::Manual \- an overview of Type::Tiny
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Type::Tiny is a small class for writing type constraints, inspired by
Moose's type constraint \s-1API.\s0 It has only one non-core dependency (and even
that is simply a module that was previously distributed as part of Type::Tiny
but has since been spun off), and can be used with Moose, Mouse and
Moo (or none of the above).
.PP
Type::Tiny is bundled with Type::Library a framework for organizing type
constraints into collections.
.PP
Also bundled is Types::Standard, a Moose-inspired library of useful type
constraints.
.PP
Type::Params is also provided, to allow very fast checking and coercion
of function and method parameters.

.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "DEPENDENCIES"
Type::Tiny requires at least Perl 5.6.1, though certain Unicode-related
features (e.g. non-ASCII type constraint names) may work better in newer
versions of Perl.
.PP
Type::Tiny requires Exporter::Tiny, a module that was previously
bundled in this distribution, but has since been spun off as a separate
distribution. Don't worry \- it's quick and easy to install.
.PP
At run-time, Type::Tiny also requires the following modules: B,
B::Deparse, Carp, Data::Dumper, Scalar::Util, Text::Balanced,
overload, strict and warnings. All of these come bundled with
Perl itself. Prior to Perl 5.8, Scalar::Util and Text::Balanced
do not come bundled with Perl and will need installing separately from
the \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
Certain features require additional modules. Tying a variable to a
type constraint (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`tie my $count, Int\*(C'\fR) requires Type::Tie;
stack traces on exceptions require Devel::StackTrace. The
Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny plugin for Reply requires Reply
(obviously). Devel::LexAlias may \fIslightly\fR increase the speed
of some of Type::Tiny's compiled coderefs.
.PP
Type::Tiny::XS is not required, but if available provides a speed
boost for some type checks. (Setting the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS\*(C'\fR to false, or setting \f(CW\*(C`PERL_ONLY\*(C'\fR to true will
suppress the use of Type::Tiny::XS, even if it is available.)
.PP
The test suite additionally requires Test::More, Test::Fatal
and Test::Requires. Test::More comes bundled with Perl, but if
you are using a version of Perl older than 5.14, you will need to
upgrade to at least Test::More version 0.96. Test::Requires and
Test::Fatal (plus Try::Tiny which Test::Fatal depends on) are bundled
with Type::Tiny in the \f(CW\*(C`inc\*(C'\fR directory, so you do not need to
install them separately.
.PP
If using Type::Tiny in conjunction with Moo, then at least Moo
1.000000 is recommended. If using Type::Tiny with Moose, then at
least Moose 2.0000 is recommended. If using Type::Tiny with Mouse,
then at least Mouse 1.00 is recommended. Type::Tiny is mostly
untested against older versions of these packages.
.SH "TYPE::TINY VERSUS X"
.IX Header "TYPE::TINY VERSUS X"
.SS "Specio"
.IX Subsection "Specio"
Type::Tiny is similar in aim to Specio. The major differences are
.IP "\(bu" 4
Type::Tiny is \*(L"tiny\*(R" (Specio will eventually have fewer dependencies
than it currently does, but is unlikely to ever have as few as Type::Tiny);
.IP "\(bu" 4
Specio has a somewhat nicer \s-1API\s0 (better method names; less duplication),
and its \s-1API\s0 is likely to improve further. Type::Tiny's aims at complete
compatibility with current versions of Moose and Mouse, so there is a
limit to how much I can deviate from the existing APIs of
(Moose|Mouse)::Meta::TypeConstraint.
.SS "MooseX::Types"
.IX Subsection "MooseX::Types"
Type::Tiny libraries expose a similar interface to MooseX::Types libraries.
In most cases you should be able to rewrite a MooseX::Types library to
use Type::Tiny pretty easily.
.SS "MooX::Types::MooseLike"
.IX Subsection "MooX::Types::MooseLike"
Type::Tiny is faster and supports coercions.
.SS "Scalar::Does"
.IX Subsection "Scalar::Does"
Scalar::Does is somewhat of a precursor to Type::Tiny, but has now been
rewritten to use Type::Tiny internally.
.PP
It gives you a \f(CW\*(C`does($value, $type)\*(C'\fR function that is roughly equivalent
to \f(CW\*(C`$type\->check($value)\*(C'\fR except that \f(CW$type\fR may be one of a list
of pre-defined strings (instead of a Type::Tiny type constraint); or may be
a package name in which case it will be assumed to be a role and checked with
\&\f(CW\*(C`$value\->DOES($type)\*(C'\fR.
