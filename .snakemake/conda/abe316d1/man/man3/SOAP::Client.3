.SH "NAME"
SOAP::Client \- exists purely as a superclass for client classes declared by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The SOAP::Client class exists purely as a superclass for client classes
declared by the various SOAP::Lite transport modules. The methods it
provides are all simple accessors; they return the current value when
called with no arguments or set the attribute value and return the object
reference when called with an argument. These attributes include:
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.IP "code, message, status" 4
.IX Item "code, message, status"
Stores the response code, message, and status from the most-recent send attempt. For some protocols, such as \s-1FTP,\s0 the same value is used for all three because of the lack of finer-grained detail (the default is to ensure that all three attributes contain data, even if redundant). Other protocols (such as \s-1HTTP\s0) have distinct values in each.
.IP "endpoint" 4
.IX Item "endpoint"
Identifies the current endpoint to which messages are being sent. This should match the value of the transport method from the SOAP::Transport class, but setting this doesn't propagate to the transport object. It is better to use the transport object (or the shortcut via the SOAP::Lite object itself) when setting this.
.IP "is_success" 4
.IX Item "is_success"
The success or failure of the most-recent transmission is noted here as a boolean value.
.IP "options" 4
.IX Item "options"
The options attribute keeps a hash-table reference of additional  options and their values. At present, only one option is used by any of the transport modules:
.RS 4
.IP "compress_threshold" 4
.IX Item "compress_threshold"
The value of this option should be a numerical value. If set, and if the Compress::Zlib library is available, messages whose size in bytes exceeds this value will be compressed before sending. Both ends of the conversation must have it enabled.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Other options may be defined using this mechanism. Note that setting the options using this accessor requires a full hash reference be passed. To set just one or a few values, consider retrieving the current reference value and using it to set the key(s).
