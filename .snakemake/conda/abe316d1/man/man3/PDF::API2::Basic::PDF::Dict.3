.SH "NAME"
PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Dict \- PDF Dictionaries and Streams. Inherits from PDF::Objind
.SH "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
.IX Header "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
There are various special instance variables which are used to look after,
particularly, streams. Each begins with a space:
.IP "stream" 4
.IX Item "stream"
Holds the stream contents for output
.IP "streamfile" 4
.IX Item "streamfile"
Holds the stream contents in an external file rather than in memory. This is
not the same as a \s-1PDF\s0 file stream. The data is stored in its unfiltered form.
.IP "streamloc" 4
.IX Item "streamloc"
If both ' stream' and ' streamfile' are empty, this indicates where in the
source \s-1PDF\s0 the stream starts.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.ie n .SS "$type = $d\->type($type)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$type\fP = \f(CW$d\fP\->type($type)"
.IX Subsection "$type = $d->type($type)"
Get/Set the standard Type key.  It can be passed, and will return, a text value rather than a Name object.
.ie n .SS "@filters = $d\->filter(@filters)"
.el .SS "\f(CW@filters\fP = \f(CW$d\fP\->filter(@filters)"
.IX Subsection "@filters = $d->filter(@filters)"
Get/Set one or more filters being used by the optional stream attached to the dictionary.
.ie n .SS "$d\->outobjdeep($fh)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$d\fP\->outobjdeep($fh)"
.IX Subsection "$d->outobjdeep($fh)"
Outputs the contents of the dictionary to a \s-1PDF\s0 file. This is a recursive call.
.PP
It also outputs a stream if the dictionary has a stream element. If this occurs
then this method will calculate the length of the stream and insert it into the
stream's dictionary.
.ie n .SS "$d\->read_stream($force_memory)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$d\fP\->read_stream($force_memory)"
.IX Subsection "$d->read_stream($force_memory)"
Reads in a stream from a \s-1PDF\s0 file. If the stream is greater than
\&\f(CW\*(C`PDF::Dict::mincache\*(C'\fR (defaults to 32768) bytes to be stored, then
the default action is to create a file for it somewhere and to use that
file as a data cache. If \f(CW$force_memory\fR is set, this caching will not
occur and the data will all be stored in the \f(CW$self\fR\->{' stream'}
variable.
.ie n .SS "$d\->val"
.el .SS "\f(CW$d\fP\->val"
.IX Subsection "$d->val"
Returns the dictionary, which is itself.
