.SH "NAME"
Template::Tools::ttree \- Process entire directory trees of templates
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&    ttree [options] [files]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIttree\fR script is used to process entire directory trees containing
template files.  The resulting output from processing each file is then 
written to a corresponding file in a destination directory.  The script
compares the modification times of source and destination files (where
they already exist) and processes only those files that have been modified.
In other words, it is the equivalent of 'make' for the Template Toolkit.
.PP
It supports a number of options which can be used to configure
behaviour, define locations and set Template Toolkit options.  The
script first reads the \fI.ttreerc\fR configuration file in the \s-1HOME\s0
directory, or an alternative file specified in the \s-1TTREERC\s0 environment
variable.  Then, it processes any command line arguments, including
any additional configuration files specified via the \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR (file)
option.
.SS "The \fI.ttreerc\fP Configuration File"
.IX Subsection "The .ttreerc Configuration File"
When you run \fIttree\fR for the first time it will ask you if you want
it to create a \fI.ttreerc\fR file for you.  This will be created in your
home directory.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $ ttree
\&    Do you want me to create a sample \*(Aq.ttreerc\*(Aq file for you?
\&    (file: /home/abw/.ttreerc)   [y/n]: y
\&    /home/abw/.ttreerc created.  Please edit accordingly and re\-run ttree
.Ve
.PP
The purpose of this file is to set any \fIglobal\fR configuration options
that you want applied \fIevery\fR time \fIttree\fR is run. For example, you
can use the \f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`link\*(C'\fR options to provide regular
expressions that specify which files should be ignored and which
should be copied or linked rather than being processed as templates.
You may also want to set flags like \f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`recurse\*(C'\fR
according to your preference.
.PP
A minimal \fI.ttreerc\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # ignore these files
\&    ignore = \eb(CVS|RCS)\eb
\&    ignore = ^#
\&    ignore = ~$
\&
\&    # copy these files
\&    copy   = \e.(gif|png|jpg|pdf)$ 
\&
\&    # recurse into directories
\&    recurse
\&
\&    # provide info about what\*(Aqs going on
\&    verbose
.Ve
.PP
In most cases, you'll want to create a different \fIttree\fR configuration 
file for each project you're working on.  The \f(CW\*(C`cfg\*(C'\fR option allows you
to specify a directory where \fIttree\fR can find further configuration 
files.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cfg = /home/abw/.ttree
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR command line option can be used to specify which configuration
file should be used.  You can specify a filename using an absolute or 
relative path:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ ttree \-f /home/abw/web/example/etc/ttree.cfg
\&    $ ttree \-f ./etc/ttree.cfg
\&    $ ttree \-f ../etc/ttree.cfg
.Ve
.PP
If the configuration file does not begin with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR or something
that looks like a MS-DOS absolute path (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`C:\e\eetc\e\ettree.cfg\*(C'\fR) then
\&\fIttree\fR will look for it in the directory specified by the \f(CW\*(C`cfg\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ttree \-f test1          # /home/abw/.ttree/test1
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`cfg\*(C'\fR option can only be used in the \fI.ttreerc\fR file.  All the
other options can be used in the \fI.ttreerc\fR or any other \fIttree\fR
configuration file.  They can all also be specified as command line
options.
.PP
Remember that \fI.ttreerc\fR is always processed \fIbefore\fR any
configuration file specified with the \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR option.  Certain options
like \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR can be used any number of times and accumulate their values.
.PP
For example, consider the following configuration files:
.PP
\&\fI/home/abw/.ttreerc\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    cfg = /home/abw/.ttree
\&    lib = /usr/local/tt2/templates
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI/home/abw/.ttree/myconfig\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    lib = /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib
.Ve
.PP
When \fIttree\fR is invoked as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ttree \-f myconfig
.Ve
.PP
the \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR option will be set to the following directories:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    /usr/local/tt2/templates
\&    /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib
.Ve
.PP
Any templates located under \fI/usr/local/tt2/templates\fR will be used
in preference to those located under
\&\fI/home/abw/web/example/templates/lib\fR.  This may be what you want,
but then again, it might not.  For this reason, it is good practice to
keep the \fI.ttreerc\fR as simple as possible and use different
configuration files for each \fIttree\fR project.
.SS "Directory Options"
.IX Subsection "Directory Options"
The \f(CW\*(C`src\*(C'\fR option is used to define the directory containing the
source templates to be processed.  It can be provided as a command
line option or in a configuration file as shown here:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    src = /home/abw/web/example/templates/src
.Ve
.PP
Each template in this directory typically corresponds to a single
web page or other document.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`dest\*(C'\fR option is used to specify the destination directory for the
generated output.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    dest = /home/abw/web/example/html
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR option is used to define one or more directories containing
additional library templates.  These templates are not documents in
their own right and typically comprise of smaller, modular components
like headers, footers and menus that are incorporated into pages templates.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    lib = /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib
\&    lib = /usr/local/tt2/templates
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR option can be used repeatedly to add further directories to
the search path.
.PP
A list of templates can be passed to \fIttree\fR as command line arguments.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ttree foo.html bar.html
.Ve
.PP
It looks for these templates in the \f(CW\*(C`src\*(C'\fR directory and processes them
through the Template Toolkit, using any additional template components
from the \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR directories.  The generated output is then written to 
the corresponding file in the \f(CW\*(C`dest\*(C'\fR directory.
.PP
If \fIttree\fR is invoked without explicitly specifying any templates
to be processed then it will process every file in the \f(CW\*(C`src\*(C'\fR directory.
If the \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR (recurse) option is set then it will additionally iterate
down through sub-directories and process and other template files it finds
therein.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ttree \-r
.Ve
.PP
If a template has been processed previously, \fIttree\fR will compare the
modification times of the source and destination files.  If the source
template (or one it is dependant on) has not been modified more
recently than the generated output file then \fIttree\fR will not process
it.  The \fI\-a\fR (all) option can be used to force \fIttree\fR to process
all files regardless of modification time.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ tree \-a
.Ve
.PP
Any templates explicitly named as command line argument are always
processed and the modification time checking is bypassed.
.SS "File Options"
.IX Subsection "File Options"
The \f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`link\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR options are used to
specify Perl regexen to filter file names. Files that match any of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR options will not be processed. Remaining files that match
any of the \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`link\*(C'\fR regexen will be copied or linked to the
destination directory. Remaining files that then match any of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR criteria are then processed via the Template Toolkit. If no
\&\f(CW\*(C`accept\*(C'\fR parameter is specified then all files will be accepted for
processing if not already copied or ignored.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # ignore these files
\&    ignore = \eb(CVS|RCS)\eb
\&    ignore = ^#
\&    ignore = ~$
\&
\&    # copy these files
\&    copy   = \e.(gif|png|jpg|pdf)$ 
\&
\&    # accept only .tt2 templates
\&    accept = \e.tt2$
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`suffix\*(C'\fR option is used to define mappings between the file
extensions for source templates and the generated output files.  The
following example specifies that source templates with a \f(CW\*(C`.tt2\*(C'\fR
suffix should be output as \f(CW\*(C`.html\*(C'\fR files:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    suffix tt2=html
.Ve
.PP
Or on the command line,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-\-suffix tt2=html
.Ve
.PP
You can provide any number of different suffix mappings by repeating 
this option.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR option is used to set the encoding of the output file.
For example use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-binmode=:utf8\*(C'\fR to set the output format to unicode.
.SS "Template Dependencies"
.IX Subsection "Template Dependencies"
The \f(CW\*(C`depend\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`depend_file\*(C'\fR options allow you to specify
how any given template file depends on another file or group of files. 
The \f(CW\*(C`depend\*(C'\fR option is used to express a single dependency.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $ ttree \-\-depend foo=bar,baz
.Ve
.PP
This command line example shows the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-depend\*(C'\fR option being used to
specify that the \fIfoo\fR file is dependant on the \fIbar\fR and \fIbaz\fR
templates.  This option can be used many time on the command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $ ttree \-\-depend foo=bar,baz \-\-depend crash=bang,wallop
.Ve
.PP
or in a configuration file:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  depend foo=bar,baz
\&  depend crash=bang,wallop
.Ve
.PP
The file appearing on the left of the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR is specified relative to
the \f(CW\*(C`src\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`lib\*(C'\fR directories.  The file(s) appearing on the right
can be specified relative to any of these directories or as absolute
file paths.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $ ttree \-\-depend foo=bar,/tmp/baz
.Ve
.PP
To define a dependency that applies to all files, use \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR on the 
left of the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $ ttree \-\-depend *=header,footer
.Ve
.PP
or in a configuration file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  depend *=header,footer
.Ve
.PP
Any templates that are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`pre_process\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`post_process\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`process\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`wrapper\*(C'\fR options will automatically be added to the
list of global dependencies that apply to all templates.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`depend_file\*(C'\fR option can be used to specify a file that contains
dependency information.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ttree \-\-depend_file=/home/abw/web/example/etc/ttree.dep
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example of a dependency file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   # This is a comment. It is ignored.
\&  
\&   index.html: header footer menubar 
\&  
\&   header: titlebar hotlinks
\&  
\&   menubar: menuitem
\&  
\&   # spanning multiple lines with the backslash
\&   another.html: header footer menubar \e
\&   sidebar searchform
.Ve
.PP
Lines beginning with the \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character are comments and are ignored.
Blank lines are also ignored.  All other lines should provide a
filename followed by a colon and then a list of dependant files
separated by whitespace, commas or both.  Whitespace around the colon
is also optional.  Lines ending in the \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR character are continued
onto the following line.
.PP
Files that contain spaces can be quoted. That is only necessary
for files after the colon (':'). The file before the colon may be
quoted if it contains a colon.
.PP
As with the command line options, the \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR character can be used
as a wildcard to specify a dependency for all templates.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    * : config,header
.Ve
.SS "Template Toolkit Options"
.IX Subsection "Template Toolkit Options"
\&\fIttree\fR also provides access to the usual range of Template Toolkit
options.  For example, the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-pre_chomp\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-post_chomp\*(C'\fR \fIttree\fR
options correspond to the \f(CW\*(C`PRE_CHOMP\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`POST_CHOMP\*(C'\fR options.
.PP
Run \f(CW\*(C`ttree \-h\*(C'\fR for a summary of the options available.
