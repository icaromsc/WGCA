.Ve
.PP
Option names & default values taken from the \s-1PHRAP\s0 manual:
.PP
1. Scoring of pairwise alignments
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-penalty \-2
\&Mismatch (substitution) penalty for SWAT comparisons.
\&
\& \-gap_init penalty\-2
\&Gap initiation penalty for SWAT comparisons.
\&
\& \-gap_ext  penalty\-1
\&Gap extension penalty for SWAT comparisons.
\&
\& \-ins_gap_ext gap_ext
\& Insertion gap extension penalty for SWAT comparisons (insertion in
\&subject relative to query).
\&
\& \-del_gap_ext gap_ext
\& Deletion gap extension penalty for SWAT comparisons (deletion in
\&subject relative to query).
\&
\& \-matrix [None]
\& Score matrix for SWAT comparisons (if present, supersedes \-penalty)
\&
\& \-raw *
\& Use raw rather than complexity\-adjusted Smith\-Waterman scores.
.Ve
.PP
2. Banded search
.PP
.Vb 3
\& \-maxmatch 30
\& Maximum length of matching word. For cross_match, the default value
\&is equal to minmatch, instead of 30.
\&
\& \-max_group_size 20
\& Group size (query file, forward strand words)
\&
\& \-word_raw *
\& Use raw rather than complexity\-adjusted word length, in testing
\&against minmatch (N.B. maxmatch always refer to raw lengths).  (The
\&default is to adjust word length to reflect complexity of matching
\&sequence).
\&
\& \-bandwidth 14
\& 1/2 band width for banded SWAT searches (full width is 2 times
\&bandwidth + 1). Decreasing bandwidth also decreases running time at
\&the expense of sensitivity. Phrap assemblies of clones containing long
\&tandem repeats of a short repeat unit (< 30 bp) may be more accurately
\&assembled by decreasing \-bandwidth; \-bandwidth should be set such that
\&2 bandwidth + 1 is less than the length of a repeat unit. \-bandwidth 0
\&can be used to find gap\-free alignments.
.Ve
.PP
3. Filtering of matches
.PP
.Vb 2
\& \-minscore 30
\& Minimum alignment score.
\&
\& \-vector_bound 80
\& Number of potential vector bases at beginning of each read.  Matches
\&that lie entirely within this region are assumed to represent vector
\&matches and are ignored.  For cross_match, the default value is 0
\&instead of 80.
\&
\& \-masklevel 80
\& (cross_match only). A match is reported only if at least (100 \-
\&masklevel)% of the bases in its "domain" (the part of the query that
\&is aligned) are not contained within the domain of any higher\-scoring
\&match.
\& Special cases:
\&    \-masklevel 0     report only the single highest scoring match for each query
\&    \-masklevel 100   report any match whose domain is not completely contained
\&                         within a higher scoring match
\&    \-masklevel 101   report all matches
.Ve
.PP
4. Input data interpretation
.PP
.Vb 7
\& \-default_qual 15
\& Quality value to be used for each base, when no input .qual file is
\&provided. Note that a quality value of 15 corresponds to an error rate
\&of approximately 1 in 30 bases, i.e. relatively accurate sequence. If
\&you are using sequence that is substantially less accurate than this
\&and do not have phred\-generated quality values you should be sure to
\&decrease the value of this parameter.
\&
\& \-subclone_delim .
\& (phrap only). Subclone name delimiter: Character used to indicate end
\&of that part of the read name that corresponds to the subclone name
\&
\& \-n_delim 1
\& (phrap only). Indicates which occurrence of the subclone delimiter
\&character denotes the end of the subclone name (so for example
\&     \-subclone_delim _ \-n_delim 2
\&means that the end of the subclone name occurs at the
\&second occurrence of the character \*(Aq_\*(Aq). Must be the same for all
\&reads!
\&
\& \-group_delim _
\& (phrap only). Group name delimiter: Character used to indicate end of
\&that part of the read name that corresponds to the group name
\&(relevant only if option \-preassemble is used); this character must
\&occur before the subclone delimiter (else it has no effect, and the
\&read is not assigned to a group).
\&
\& \-trim_start 0
\& (phrap only). No. of bases to be removed at beginning of each read.
.Ve
.PP
5. Assembly
.PP
.Vb 4
\& \-forcelevel 0
\& (phrap only). Relaxes stringency to varying degree during final
\&contig merge pass.  Allowed values are integers from 0 (most
\&stringent) to 10 (least stringent), inclusive.
\&
\& \-bypasslevel 1
\& (phrap only). Controls treatment of inconsistent reads in merge.
\&Currently allowed values are 0 (no bypasses allowed; most stringent)
\&and 1 (a single conflicting read may be bypassed).
\&
\& \-maxgap 30
\& (phrap only). Maximum permitted size of an unmatched region in
\&merging contigs, during first (most stringent) merging pass.
\&
\& \-repeat_stringency .95
\& (phrap only). Controls stringency of match required for joins.  Must
\&be less than 1 (highest stringency), and greater than 0 (lowest
\&stringency).
\&
\& \-revise_greedy *
\& (phrap only). Splits initial greedy assembly into pieces at "weak
\&joins", and then tries to reattach them to give higher overall score.
\&Use of this option should correct some types of missassembly.
\&
\& \-shatter_greedy *
\& (phrap only). Breaks assembly at weak joins (as with \-revise_greedy)
\&but does not try to reattach pieces.
\&
\& \-preassemble *
\& (phrap only). Preassemble reads within groups, prior to merging with
\&other groups. This is useful for example when the input data set
\&consists of reads from two distinct but overlapping clones, and it is
\&desired to assemble the reads from each clone separately before
\&merging in order to reduce the risk of incorrect joins due to
\&repeats. The preassemble merging pass is relatively stringent and not
\&guaranteed to merge all of the reads from a group.
\& Groups are indicated by the first part of the read name, up to the
\&character specified by \-group_delim.
\&
\& \-force_high *
\& (phrap only). Causes edited high\-quality discrepancies to be ignored
\&during final contig merge pass.  This option may be useful when it is
\&suspected that incorrect edits are causing a misassembly.
.Ve
.PP
6. Consensus sequence construction
.PP
.Vb 3
\& \-node_seg 8
\& (phrap only). Minimum segment size (for purposes of traversing
\&weighted directed graph).
\&
\& \-node_space 4
\& (phrap only). Spacing between nodes (in weighted directed graph).
.Ve
.PP
7. Output
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Not implemented in this Perl module.

.PP
8. Miscellaneous
.PP
.Vb 3
\& \-retain_duplicates *
\& (phrap only). Retain exact duplicate reads, rather than eliminating
\&them.
\&
\& \-max_subclone_size 5000
\& (phrap only). Maximum subclone size \-\- for forward\-reverse read pair
\&consistency checks.
\&
\& \-trim_penalty \-2
\& (phrap only). Penalty used for identifying degenerate sequence at
\&beginning & end of read.
\&
\& \-trim_score 20
\& (phrap only). Minimum score for identifying degenerate sequence at
\&beginning & end of read.
\&
\& \-trim_qual 13
\& (phrap only). Quality value used in to define the "high\-quality" part
\&of a read, (the part which should overlap; this is used to adjust
\&qualities at ends of reads.
\&
\& \-confirm_length 8
\& (phrap only). Minimum size of confirming segment (segment starts at
\&3d distinct nuc following discrepancy).
\&
\& \-confirm_trim 1
\& (phrap only). Amount by which confirming segments are trimmed at
\&edges.
\&
\& \-confirm_penalty \-5
\& (phrap only). Penalty used in aligning against "confirming" reads.
\&
\& \-confirm_score 30
\& (phrap only). Minimum alignment score for a read to be allowed to
\&"confirm" part of another read.
\&
\& \-indexwordsize 10
\& Size of indexing (hashing) words, used in finding word matches
\&between sequences.  The value of this parameter has a generally minor
\&effect on run time and memory usage.
