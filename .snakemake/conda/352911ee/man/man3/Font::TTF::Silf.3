Font::TTF::Silf \- The main Graphite table
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Silf table holds the core of the Graphite rules for a font. A Silf table has
potentially multiple silf subtables, although there is usually only one. Within a silf subtable,
there are a number of passes which contain the actual finite state machines to match rules
and the constraint and action code to be executed when a rule matches.
