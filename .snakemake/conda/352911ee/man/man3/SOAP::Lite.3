.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
All accessor methods return the current value when called with no arguments,
while returning the object reference itself when called with a new value.
This allows the set-attribute calls to be chained together.
.IP "new(optional key/value pairs)" 4
.IX Item "new(optional key/value pairs)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client = SOAP::Lite\->new(proxy => $endpoint)
.Ve
.Sp
Constructor. Many of the accessor methods defined here may be initialized at
creation by providing their name as a key, followed by the desired value.
The example provides the value for the proxy element of the client.
.IP "transport(optional transport object)" 4
.IX Item "transport(optional transport object)"
.Vb 1
\&    $transp = $client\->transport( );
.Ve
.Sp
Gets or sets the transport object used for sending/receiving \s-1SOAP\s0 messages.
.Sp
See SOAP::Transport for details.
.IP "serializer(optional serializer object)" 4
.IX Item "serializer(optional serializer object)"
.Vb 1
\&    $serial = $client\->serializer( )
.Ve
.Sp
Gets or sets the serializer object used for creating \s-1XML\s0 messages.
.Sp
See SOAP::Serializer for details.
.IP "packager(optional packager object)" 4
.IX Item "packager(optional packager object)"
.Vb 1
\&    $packager = $client\->packager( )
.Ve
.Sp
Provides access to the \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Packager\*(C'\fR object that the client uses to manage
the use of attachments. The default packager is a \s-1MIME\s0 packager, but unless
you specify parts to send, no \s-1MIME\s0 formatting will be done.
.Sp
See also: SOAP::Packager.
.IP "proxy(endpoint, optional extra arguments)" 4
.IX Item "proxy(endpoint, optional extra arguments)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->proxy(\*(Aqhttp://soap.xml.info/ endPoint\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
The proxy is the server or endpoint to which the client is going to connect.
This method allows the setting of the endpoint, along with any extra
information that the transport object may need when communicating the request.
.Sp
This method is actually an alias to the proxy method of SOAP::Transport.
It is the same as typing:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->transport( )\->proxy(...arguments);
.Ve
.Sp
Extra parameters can be passed to \fIproxy()\fR \- see below.

.IP "All initialization options from the underlying transport layer" 4
.IX Item "All initialization options from the underlying transport layer"
The options for \s-1HTTP\s0(S) are the same as for LWP::UserAgent's \fInew()\fR method.
.Sp
A common option is to create a instance of HTTP::Cookies and pass it as
cookie_jar option:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies\->new()
\& $client\->proxy(\*(Aqhttp://www.example.org/webservice\*(Aq,
\&    cookie_jar => $cookie_jar,
\& );
.Ve
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
For example, if you wish to set the \s-1HTTP\s0 timeout for a SOAP::Lite client to 5
seconds, use the following code:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  my $soap = SOAP::Lite
\&   \->uri($uri)
\&   \->proxy($proxyUrl, timeout => 5 );
.Ve
.Sp
See LWP::UserAgent.

.IP "endpoint(optional new endpoint address)" 4
.IX Item "endpoint(optional new endpoint address)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->endpoint(\*(Aqhttp://soap.xml.info/ newPoint\*(Aq)
.Ve
.Sp
It may be preferable to set a new endpoint without the additional work of
examining the new address for protocol information and checking to ensure the
support code is loaded and available. This method allows the caller to change
the endpoint that the client is currently set to connect to, without
reloading the relevant transport code. Note that the proxy method must have
been called before this method is used.
.IP "service(service \s-1URL\s0)" 4
.IX Item "service(service URL)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->service(\*(Aqhttp://svc.perl.org/Svc.wsdl\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR offers some support for creating method stubs from service
descriptions. At present, only \s-1WSDL\s0 support is in place. This method loads
the specified \s-1WSDL\s0 schema and uses it as the basis for generating stubs.
.IP "outputxml(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "outputxml(boolean)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->outputxml(\*(Aqtrue\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
When set to a true value, the raw \s-1XML\s0 is returned by the call to a remote
method.
.Sp
The default is to return the a \s-1SOAP::SOM\s0 object (false).
.IP "autotype(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "autotype(boolean)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->autotype(0);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->autotype(boolean);
.Ve
.Sp
By default, the serializer tries to automatically deduce types for the data
being sent in a message. Setting a false value with this method disables the
behavior.
.IP "readable(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "readable(boolean)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->readable(1);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->readable(boolean);
.Ve
.Sp
When this is used to set a true value for this property, the generated \s-1XML\s0
sent to the endpoint has extra characters (spaces and new lines) added in to
make the \s-1XML\s0 itself more readable to human eyes (presumably for debugging).
The default is to not send any additional characters.
.IP "headerattr(hash reference of attributes)" 4
.IX Item "headerattr(hash reference of attributes)"
.Vb 1
\&    $obj\->headerattr({ attr1 => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq });
.Ve
.Sp
Allows for the setting of arbitrary attributes on the header object. Keep in mind the requirement that
 any attributes not natively known to \s-1SOAP\s0 must be namespace-qualified.
If using \f(CW$session\fR\->call ($method, \f(CW$callData\fR, \f(CW$callHeader\fR), SOAP::Lite serializes the informations as
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&  <soap:Envelope>
\&    <soap:Header>
\&      <userId>xxxxx</userId>
\&      <password>yyyyy</password>
\&    </soap:Header>

\&        <foo />
\&      </myMethod>
\&    </soap:Body>
\&  </soap:Envelope>
.Ve
.Sp
The attributes, given to headerattr are placed into the Header as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    <soap:Header attr1="value">
.Ve
.IP "bodyattr(hash reference of attributes)" 4
.IX Item "bodyattr(hash reference of attributes)"
.Vb 1
\&    $obj\->bodyattr({ attr1 => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq });
.Ve
.Sp
Allows for the setting of arbitrary attributes on the body object. Keep in mind the requirement that
 any attributes not natively known to \s-1SOAP\s0 must be namespace-qualified.
See headerattr
.IP "default_ns($uri)" 4
.IX Item "default_ns($uri)"
Sets the default namespace for the request to the specified uri. This
overrides any previous namespace declaration that may have been set using a
previous call to \f(CW\*(C`ns()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`default_ns()\*(C'\fR. Setting the default namespace
causes elements to be serialized without a namespace prefix, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  <soap:Envelope>
\&    <soap:Body>
\&      <myMethod xmlns="http://www.someuri.com">
\&        <foo />
\&      </myMethod>
\&    </soap:Body>
\&  </soap:Envelope>
.Ve
.Sp
Some .NET web services have been reported to require this \s-1XML\s0 namespace idiom.
.IP "ns($uri,$prefix=undef)" 4
.IX Item "ns($uri,$prefix=undef)"
Sets the namespace uri and optionally the namespace prefix for the request to
the specified values. This overrides any previous namespace declaration that
may have been set using a previous call to \f(CW\*(C`ns()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`default_ns()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If a prefix is not specified, one will be generated for you automatically.
Setting the namespace causes elements to be serialized with a declared
namespace prefix, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  <soap:Envelope>
\&    <soap:Body>
\&      <my:myMethod xmlns:my="http://www.someuri.com">
\&        <my:foo />
\&      </my:myMethod>
\&    </soap:Body>
\&  </soap:Envelope>
.Ve
.IP "use_prefix(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "use_prefix(boolean)"
Deprecated. Use the \f(CW\*(C`ns()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`default_ns\*(C'\fR methods described above.
.Sp
Shortcut for \f(CW\*(C`serializer\->use_prefix()\*(C'\fR. This lets you turn on/off the
use of a namespace prefix for the children of the /Envelope/Body element.
Default is 'true'.
.Sp
When use_prefix is set to 'true', serialized \s-1XML\s0 will look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  <SOAP\-ENV:Envelope ...attributes skipped>
\&    <SOAP\-ENV:Body>
\&      <namesp1:mymethod xmlns:namesp1="urn:MyURI" />
\&    </SOAP\-ENV:Body>
\&  </SOAP\-ENV:Envelope>
.Ve
.Sp
When use_prefix is set to 'false', serialized \s-1XML\s0 will look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  <SOAP\-ENV:Envelope ...attributes skipped>
\&    <SOAP\-ENV:Body>
\&      <mymethod xmlns="urn:MyURI" />
\&    </SOAP\-ENV:Body>
\&  </SOAP\-ENV:Envelope>
.Ve
.Sp
Some .NET web services have been reported to require this \s-1XML\s0 namespace idiom.
.IP "soapversion(optional value)" 4
.IX Item "soapversion(optional value)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->soapversion(\*(Aq1.2\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
If no parameter is given, returns the current version of \s-1SOAP\s0 that is being
used by the client object to encode requests. If a parameter is given, the
method attempts to set that as the version of \s-1SOAP\s0 being used.
.Sp
The value should be either 1.1 or 1.2.
.IP "envprefix(QName)" 4
.IX Item "envprefix(QName)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->envprefix(\*(Aqenv\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->envprefix(QName);
.Ve
.Sp
Gets or sets the namespace prefix for the \s-1SOAP\s0 namespace. The default is
\&\s-1SOAP.\s0
.Sp
The prefix itself has no meaning, but applications may wish to chose one
explicitly to denote different versions of \s-1SOAP\s0 or the like.
.IP "encprefix(QName)" 4
.IX Item "encprefix(QName)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->encprefix(\*(Aqenc\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->encprefix(QName);
.Ve
.Sp
Gets or sets the namespace prefix for the encoding rules namespace.
The default value is SOAP-ENC.
.PP
While it may seem to be an unnecessary operation to set a value that isn't
relevant to the message, such as the namespace labels for the envelope and
encoding URNs, the ability to set these labels explicitly can prove to be a
great aid in distinguishing and debugging messages on the server side of
operations.
.IP "encoding(encoding \s-1URN\s0)" 4
.IX Item "encoding(encoding URN)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->encoding($soap_12_encoding_URN);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->encoding(args);
.Ve
.Sp
Where the earlier method dealt with the label used for the attributes related
to the \s-1SOAP\s0 encoding scheme, this method actually sets the \s-1URN\s0 to be specified
as the encoding scheme for the message. The default is to specify the encoding
for \s-1SOAP 1.1,\s0 so this is handy for applications that need to encode according
to \s-1SOAP 1.2\s0 rules.
.IP "typelookup" 4
.IX Item "typelookup"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->typelookup;
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->typelookup;
.Ve
.Sp
Gives the application access to the type-lookup table from the serializer
object. See the section on SOAP::Serializer.
.IP "uri(service specifier)" 4
.IX Item "uri(service specifier)"
Deprecated \- the \f(CW\*(C`uri\*(C'\fR subroutine is deprecated in order to provide a more
intuitive naming scheme for subroutines that set namespaces. In the future,
you will be required to use either the \f(CW\*(C`ns()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`default_ns()\*(C'\fR subroutines
instead of \f(CW\*(C`uri()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->uri($service_uri);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->uri(service);
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1URI\s0 associated with this accessor on a client object is the
service-specifier for the request, often encoded for HTTP-based requests as
the SOAPAction header. While the names may seem confusing, this method
doesn't specify the endpoint itself. In most circumstances, the \f(CW\*(C`uri\*(C'\fR refers
to the namespace used for the request.
.Sp
Often times, the value may look like a valid \s-1URL.\s0 Despite this, it doesn't
have to point to an existing resource (and often doesn't). This method sets
and retrieves this value from the object. Note that no transport code is
triggered by this because it has no direct effect on the transport of the
object.
.IP "multirefinplace(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "multirefinplace(boolean)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->multirefinplace(1);
.Ve
.Sp
This method is a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->serializer\->multirefinplace(boolean);
.Ve
.Sp
Controls how the serializer handles values that have multiple references to
them. Recall from previous \s-1SOAP\s0 chapters that a value may be tagged with an
identifier, then referred to in several places. When this is the case for a
value, the serializer defaults to putting the data element towards the top of
the message, right after the opening tag of the method-specification. It is
serialized as a standalone entity with an \s-1ID\s0 that is then referenced at the
relevant places later on. If this method is used to set a true value, the
behavior is different. When the multirefinplace attribute is true, the data
is serialized at the first place that references it, rather than as a separate
element higher up in the body. This is more compact but may be harder to read
or trace in a debugging environment.
.IP "parts( \s-1ARRAY\s0 )" 4
.IX Item "parts( ARRAY )"
Used to specify an array of MIME::Entity's to be attached to the
transmitted \s-1SOAP\s0 message. Attachments that are returned in a response can be
accessed by \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::SOM::parts()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "self" 4
.IX Item "self"
.Vb 1
\&    $ref = SOAP::Lite\->self;
.Ve
.Sp
Returns an object reference to the default global object the \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR
package maintains. This is the object that processes many of the arguments
when provided on the use line.
.PP
The following method isn't an accessor style of method but neither does it fit
with the group that immediately follows it:
.IP "call(arguments)" 4
.IX Item "call(arguments)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->call($method => @arguments);
.Ve
.Sp
As has been illustrated in previous chapters, the \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR client objects
can manage remote calls with auto-dispatching using some of Perl's more
elaborate features. call is used when the application wants a greater degree
of control over the details of the call itself. The method may be built up
from a SOAP::Data object, so as to allow full control over the namespace
associated with the tag, as well as other attributes like encoding. This is
also important for calling methods that contain characters not allowable in
Perl function names, such as A.B.C.
.PP
The next four methods used in the \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR class are geared towards
handling the types of events than can occur during the message lifecycle. Each
of these sets up a callback for the event in question:
.IP "on_action(callback)" 4
.IX Item "on_action(callback)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->on_action(sub { qq("$_[0]") });
.Ve
.Sp
Triggered when the transport object sets up the SOAPAction header for an
HTTP-based call. The default is to set the header to the string, uri#method,
in which \s-1URI\s0 is the value set by the uri method described earlier, and method
is the name of the method being called. When called, the routine referenced
(or the closure, if specified as in the example) is given two arguments, uri
and method, in that order.
.Sp
\&.NET web services usually expect \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as separator for \f(CW\*(C`uri\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`method\*(C'\fR.
To change SOAP::Lite's behaviour to use uri/method as SOAPAction header, use
the following code:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->on_action( sub { join \*(Aq/\*(Aq, @_ } );
.Ve
.IP "on_fault(callback)" 4
.IX Item "on_fault(callback)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->on_fault(sub { popup_dialog($_[1]) });
.Ve
.Sp
Triggered when a method call results in a fault response from the server.
When it is called, the argument list is first the client object itself,
followed by the object that encapsulates the fault. In the example, the fault
object is passed (without the client object) to a hypothetical \s-1GUI\s0 function
that presents an error dialog with the text of fault extracted from the object
(which is covered shortly under the \s-1SOAP::SOM\s0 methods).
.IP "on_nonserialized(callback)" 4
.IX Item "on_nonserialized(callback)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->on_nonserialized(sub { die "$_[0]?!?" });
.Ve
.Sp
Occasionally, the serializer may be given data it can't turn into SOAP-savvy
\&\s-1XML\s0; for example, if a program bug results in a code reference or something
similar being passed in as a parameter to method call. When that happens, this
callback is activated, with one argument. That argument is the data item that
could not be understood. It will be the only argument. If the routine returns,
the return value is pasted into the message as the serialization. Generally,
an error is in order, and this callback allows for control over signaling that
error.
.IP "on_debug(callback)" 4
.IX Item "on_debug(callback)"
.Vb 1
\&    $client\->on_debug(sub { print @_ });
.Ve
.Sp
Deprecated. Use the global +debug and +trace facilities described in
SOAP::Trace
.Sp
Note that this method will not work as expected: Instead of affecting the
debugging behaviour of the object called on, it will globally affect the
debugging behaviour for all objects of that class.
.SH "WRITING A SOAP CLIENT"
.IX Header "WRITING A SOAP CLIENT"
This chapter guides you to writing a \s-1SOAP\s0 client by example.
.PP
The \s-1SOAP\s0 service to be accessed is a simple variation of the well-known
hello world program. It accepts two parameters, a name and a given name,
and returns \*(L"Hello \f(CW$given_name\fR \f(CW$name\fR\*(R".

.SS "\s-1SOAP\s0 message styles"
.IX Subsection "SOAP message styles"
There are three common (and one less common) variants of \s-1SOAP\s0 messages.
.PP
These address the message style (positional parameters vs. specified message
documents) and encoding (as-is vs. typed).
.PP
The different message styles are:
.IP "\(bu" 4
rpc/encoded
.Sp
Typed, positional parameters. Widely used in scripting languages.
The type of the arguments is included in the message.
Arrays and the like may be encoded using \s-1SOAP\s0 encoding rules (or others).
.IP "\(bu" 4
rpc/literal
.Sp
As-is, positional parameters. The type of arguments is defined by some
pre-exchanged interface definition.
.IP "\(bu" 4
document/encoded
.Sp
Specified message with typed elements. Rarely used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
document/literal
.Sp
Specified message with as-is elements. The message specification and
element types are defined by some pre-exchanged interface definition.
.PP
As of 2008, document/literal has become the predominant \s-1SOAP\s0 message
variant. rpc/literal and rpc/encoded are still in use, mainly with scripting
languages, while document/encoded is hardly used at all.
.PP
You will see clients for the rpc/encoded and document/literal \s-1SOAP\s0 variants in
this section.
.SS "Example implementations"
.IX Subsection "Example implementations"
\fI\s-1RPC/ENCODED\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "RPC/ENCODED"
.PP
Rpc/encoded is most popular with scripting languages like perl, php and python
without the use of a \s-1WSDL.\s0 Usual method descriptions look like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& Method: sayHello(string, string)
\& Parameters:
\&    name: string
\&    givenName: string
.Ve
.PP
Such a description usually means that you can call a method named \*(L"sayHello\*(R"
with two positional parameters, \*(L"name\*(R" and \*(L"givenName\*(R", which both are
strings.
.PP
The message corresponding to this description looks somewhat like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& <sayHello xmlns="urn:HelloWorld">
\&   <s\-gensym01 xsi:type="xsd:string">Kutter</s\-gensym01>
\&   <s\-gensym02 xsi:type="xsd:string">Martin</s\-gensym02>
\& </sayHello>
.Ve
.PP
Any \s-1XML\s0 tag names may be used instead of the \*(L"s\-gensym01\*(R" stuff \- parameters
are positional, the tag names have no meaning.
.PP
A client producing such a call is implemented like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& use SOAP::Lite;
\& my $soap = SOAP::Lite\->new( proxy => \*(Aqhttp://localhost:81/soap\-wsdl\-test/helloworld.pl\*(Aq);
\& $soap\->default_ns(\*(Aqurn:HelloWorld\*(Aq);
\& my $som = $soap\->call(\*(AqsayHello\*(Aq, \*(AqKutter\*(Aq, \*(AqMartin\*(Aq);
\& die $som\->faultstring if ($som\->fault);
\& print $som\->result, "\en";
.Ve
.PP
You can of course use a one-liner, too...
.PP
Sometimes, rpc/encoded interfaces are described with \s-1WSDL\s0 definitions.
A \s-1WSDL\s0 accepting \*(L"named\*(R" parameters with rpc/encoded looks like this:

SOAP::Lite's point of view, the only differences between rpc/literal and
document/literal that parameters are always named.
.PP
In our example, the rpc/encoded variant already used named parameters (by
using two messages), so there's no difference at all.

You may have noticed the somewhat strange idiom for passing a list of named
parameters in the rpc/literal example:

\&\fBAny\fR \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR properties can be propagated this way. Changes in object
copies will not affect global settings and you may still change global

The \f(CW\*(C`use SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR syntax also lets you specify default event handlers for

\&\f(CW\*(C`on_action()\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`on_fault()\*(C'\fR for that matter) handler. You can specify

.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use SOAP::Lite
\&    on_action => sub {sprintf \*(Aq%s#%s\*(Aq, @_};
.Ve
.PP
and this handler will be the default handler for all your \s-1SOAP\s0 objects. You
can override it if you specify a handler for a particular object. See \fIt/*.t\fR
for example of \fIon_fault()\fR handler.

.IX Subsection "IN/OUT, OUT PARAMETERS AND AUTOBINDING"
\&\f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR gives you access to all parameters (both in/out and out) and
also does some additional work for you. Lets consider following example:
.PP
.Vb 5

\&    <res1>name1</res1>
\&    <res2>name2</res2>

In that case:

\&  $paramout2 = ($r\->paramsout)[1]; # gives you \*(Aqname3\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
or

.Vb 3
\&  @paramsout = $r\->paramsout; # gives you ARRAY of out parameters
\&  $paramout1 = $paramsout[0]; # gives you \*(Aqres2\*(Aq, same as ($r\->paramsout)[0]
\&  $paramout2 = $paramsout[1]; # gives you \*(Aqres3\*(Aq, same as ($r\->paramsout)[1]
.Ve
.PP
Generally, if server returns \f(CW\*(C`return (1,2,3)\*(C'\fR you will get \f(CW1\fR as the result
and \f(CW2\fR and \f(CW3\fR as out parameters.
.PP
If the server returns \f(CW\*(C`return [1,2,3]\*(C'\fR you will get an \s-1ARRAY\s0 reference from
\&\f(CW\*(C`result()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR from \f(CW\*(C`paramsout()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Results can be arbitrary complex: they can be an array references, they can be
objects, they can be anything and still be returned by \f(CW\*(C`result()\*(C'\fR . If only
one parameter is returned, \f(CW\*(C`paramsout()\*(C'\fR will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Furthermore, if you have in your output parameters a parameter with the same
signature (name+type) as in the input parameters this parameter will be mapped
into your input automatically. For example:
.PP
\&\fBServer Code\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  sub mymethod {
\&    shift; # object/class reference
\&    my $param1 = shift;
\&    my $param2 = SOAP::Data\->name(\*(Aqmyparam\*(Aq => shift() * 2);
\&    return $param1, $param2;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBClient Code\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $a = 10;
\&  $b = SOAP::Data\->name(\*(Aqmyparam\*(Aq => 12);
\&  $result = $soap\->mymethod($a, $b);
.Ve
.PP
After that, \f(CW\*(C`$result == 10 and $b\->value == 24\*(C'\fR! Magic? Sort of.
.PP
Autobinding gives it to you. That will work with objects also with one
difference: you do not need to worry about the name and the type of object
parameter. Consider the \f(CW\*(C`PingPong\*(C'\fR example (\fIexamples/My/PingPong.pm\fR
and \fIexamples/pingpong.pl\fR):
.PP

.SS "\s-1STATIC AND DYNAMIC SERVICE DEPLOYMENT\s0"
.IX Subsection "STATIC AND DYNAMIC SERVICE DEPLOYMENT"
Let us scrutinize the deployment process. When designing your \s-1SOAP\s0 server you
can consider two kind of deployment: \fBstatic\fR and \fBdynamic\fR. For both,
static and dynamic,  you should specify \f(CW\*(C`MODULE\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`MODULE::method\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`method\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`PATH/\*(C'\fR when creating \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fRing the SOAP::Lite module. The
difference between static and dynamic deployment is that in case of 'dynamic',
any module which is not present will be loaded on demand. See the
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY\*(R"\s0 section for detailed description.
.PP
When statically deploying a \s-1SOAP\s0 Server, you need to know all modules handling
\&\s-1SOAP\s0 requests before.
.PP
Dynamic deployment allows extending your \s-1SOAP\s0 Server's interface by just
installing another module into the dispatch_to path (see below).
.PP
\fI\s-1STATIC DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE\s0\fR

.PP
For static deployment you should specify the \s-1MODULE\s0 name directly.

In addition to this \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR also supports an experimental syntax that
allows you to bind a specific \s-1URL\s0 or SOAPAction to a \s-1CLASS/MODULE\s0 or object.
.PP
For example:

\&  })
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR is checked before \f(CW\*(C`SOAPAction\*(C'\fR. You may use both the \f(CW\*(C`dispatch_to()\*(C'\fR

checked only after \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SOAPAction\*(C'\fR has been checked.

.IP "Disable charset definition in Content-type header" 4

SOAP::Lite allows users to disable the use of explicit namespaces through the

SOAP::Lite uses the \s-1SOAP\s0 encoding (section 5 of the soap 1.1 spec), and
the default for .NET Web Services is to use a literal encoding. So
elements in the request are unqualified, but your service expects them to
be qualified. .Net Web Services has a way for you to change the expected
message format, which should allow you to get your interop working.

In some cases \s-1SOAP\s0 messages created by \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR may not be parsed
properly by a SAX2/Java \s-1XML\s0 parser. This is due to a known bug in
\&\f(CW\*(C`org.xml.sax.helpers.ParserAdapter\*(C'\fR. This bug manifests itself when an
attribute in an \s-1XML\s0 element occurs prior to the \s-1XML\s0 namespace declaration on
which it depends. However, according to the \s-1XML\s0 specification, the order of
these attributes is not significant.

.IP "Processing of \s-1XML\s0 encoded fragments" 4
.IX Item "Processing of XML encoded fragments"
\&\f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR is based on XML::Parser which is basically wrapper around
James Clark's expat parser. Expat's behavior for parsing \s-1XML\s0 encoded string
can affect processing messages that have lot of encoded entities, like \s-1XML\s0
fragments, encoded as strings. Providing low-level details, parser will call
\&\fIchar()\fR callback for every portion of processed stream, but individually for
every processed entity or newline. It can lead to lot of calls and additional
memory manager expenses even for small messages. By contrast, \s-1XML\s0 messages
which are encoded as base64Binary, don't have this problem and difference in
processing time can be significant. For \s-1XML\s0 encoded string that has about 20
lines and 30 tags, number of call could be about 100 instead of one for
the same string encoded as base64Binary.
.Sp
Since it is parser's feature there is \s-1NO\s0 fix for this behavior (let me know
if you find one), especially because you need to parse message you already
got (and you cannot control content of this message), however, if your are
in charge for both ends of processing you can switch encoding to base64 on
sender's side. It will definitely work with SOAP::Lite and it \fBmay\fR work with
other toolkits/implementations also, but obviously I cannot guarantee that.
.Sp
If you want to encode specific string as base64, just do
\&\f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Data\->type(base64 => $string)\*(C'\fR either on client or on server
side. If you want change behavior for specific instance of SOAP::Lite, you
may subclass \f(CW\*(C`SOAP::Serializer\*(C'\fR, override \f(CW\*(C`as_string()\*(C'\fR method that is
responsible for string encoding (take a look into \f(CW\*(C`as_base64Binary()\*(C'\fR) and
specify \fBnew\fR serializer class for your SOAP::Lite object with:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  my $soap = new SOAP::Lite
\&    serializer => My::Serializer\->new,
\&    ..... other parameters
.Ve
.Sp
or on server side:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  my $server = new SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon # or any other server
\&    serializer => My::Serializer\->new,
\&    ..... other parameters
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to change this behavior for \fBall\fR instances of SOAP::Lite, just
substitute \f(CW\*(C`as_string()\*(C'\fR method with \f(CW\*(C`as_base64Binary()\*(C'\fR somewhere in your
code \fBafter\fR \f(CW\*(C`use SOAP::Lite\*(C'\fR and \fBbefore\fR actual processing/sending:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  *SOAP::Serializer::as_string = \e&SOAP::XMLSchema2001::Serializer::as_base64Binary;
.Ve
.Sp
Be warned that last two methods will affect \fBall\fR strings and convert them
into base64 encoded. It doesn't make any difference for SOAP::Lite, but it
\&\fBmay\fR make a difference for other toolkits.
