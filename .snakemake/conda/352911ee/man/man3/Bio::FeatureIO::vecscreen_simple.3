.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
vecscreen is a system for quickly identifying segments of a nucleic
acid sequence that may be of vector origin.  \s-1NCBI\s0 developed vecscreen
to minimize the incidence and impact of vector contamination in public
sequence databases.  GenBank Annotation Staff use vecscreen to verify
that sequences submitted for inclusion in the database are free from
contaminating vector sequence. Any sequence can be screened for vector
contamination using vecscreen.
.PP
This module provides parsing for vecscreen '\-f 3' output, described in
the vecscreen documentation as 'Text list, no alignments'
